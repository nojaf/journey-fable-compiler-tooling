# JS Only

> Compile F# to JavaScript using fable-compiler-js

Fable compiled itself, the result of this is that you end up with a piece of JavaScript that can compile F# to JavaScript.

Run `run.ps1` to launch a Docker container with only NodeJS.
Install the node_modules with `yarn` and run the sample using `yarn start`.
